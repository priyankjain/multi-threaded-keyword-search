Unfortunately that kind of battle is what addiction is all about. Take a look at Step 1 for addiction to drugs, alcohol, food, porn, sex, internet, shopping or people. It's all the same. It starts with surrender. The hijacked reward system is fed by toxic shame. This is what hypofrontality is. See www.yourbrainonporn.com for details. The reason for the massive interest in NoFap is because abstinence DOES repair reward circuits. It can restore functionality. If abstinence alone cured addiction, why are millions upon millions of people involved in these groups? If the question: WHAT IS ADDICTION were to be posed...how many "day counters" are going to be able to answer that?

Addiction is codependency. It is at least a 60 person disease. It is multi-generational. As we can see, the "90 day magic pill" isn't working. It's time that the bullshit backed off a bit. You don't defeat toxic shame (early abandonment) with white knuckled sobriety and push-ups.

Insanity. A day counters union isn't support. It's more addiction: The Underestimators Club.
