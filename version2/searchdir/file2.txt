I went to the Police like a good
American.  These two boys were
arrested and brought to trial.  The
judge sentenced them to three years
in prison, and suspended the
sentence.  Suspended sentence!
They went free that very day.  I
stood in the courtroom like a fool,
and those bastards, they smiled at
me.  Then I said to my wife, for
Justice, we must go to The Godfather.
