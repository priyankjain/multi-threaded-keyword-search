I raised my daughter in the American
fashion; I gave her freedom, but
taught her never to dishonor her
family.  She found a boy friend,
not an Italian.  She went to the
movies with him, stayed out late.
Two months ago he took her for a
drive, with another boy friend.
They made her drink whiskey and
then they tried to take advantage
of her.  She resisted; she kept her
honor.  So they beat her like an
animal.  When I went to the hospital
her nose was broken, her jaw was
shattered and held together by
wire, and she could not even weep
because of the pain.
