You will design and implement a keyword search program called ks_bb, which will take two command line arguments from the user as follows:

./ks_bb commandFile bufSize
commandFile is the name of a file, which includes the search commands to be performed. Each search

command is composed of a keyword and a dirPath. A sample content of a commandFile can be as

follows:

/home/user/dirOne is

/home/user/dirOne a

/home/user/dirTwo a

For each command, your program will search the keyword in all the files sitting in the given

directory using multiple threads.
