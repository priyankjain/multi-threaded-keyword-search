Bonasera, we know each other for
years, but this is the first time
you come to me for help.  I don't
remember the last time you invited
me to your house for coffee even
though our wives are friends.
You never think to protect yourself
with real friends.  You think it's
enough to be an American.  All
right, the Police protects you,
there are Courts of Law, so you
don't need a friend like me.
But now you come to me and say Don
Corleone, you must give me justice.
And you don't ask in respect or
friendship.  And you don't think to
call me Godfather; instead you come
to my house on the day my daughter
is to be married and you ask me to
do murder for money.
